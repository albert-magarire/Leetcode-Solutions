# Leetcode-Solutions
In this repository, I have attached all the solutions that I made to the leetcode problems that i solved. Most solutions were done in Java and Python. A few were done using C++, PHP, and Pandas

## For Each Question:
I included the problem, my thinking process (both as comments) and the final code solutions

## Time and Space Complexity
I have also calculated the space and time complexity analysis at the end of each files

I have started to include that is irrelevant because I got tired of posting my leetcode solutions here
